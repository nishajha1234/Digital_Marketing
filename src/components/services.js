        <h1>Why is SEO Important?</h1>
        <p>
          Getting to the top of page one in search results is the result of
          great SEO. websites that have top rankings are considered authority
          sites on the internet, and can bring tons of qualified visitors to
          your website who want to purchase what exactly what your company has
          to offer. A well-optimized web page can achieve high rankings for
          multiple keyword phrases. Gaining the number one ranking for a keyword
          can bring up to 33% of all clicks from searches. Unlike paid search,
          which can get your website to the top of page one until the daily
          budget is used up (at which time your site disappears), top results in
          SEO provide clicks and traffic 24/7, 365 days a year. Being
          competitive in organic search is a highly valuable asset, and can turn
          your website into a powerful revenue generator. Whether your company
          goals are to generate leads for your business or sell products through
          eCommerce, SEO should be a vital part of your overall strategy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="services_heading5">
        <h1>Is SEO More Important Than PPC?</h1>
        <p>
          Good question. Organic search results provide lower costs per click
          and significantly higher ROI than PPC. Although SEO takes more time to
          build up, once top rankings are achieved, the benefits are
          significant. The upside of PPC is the speed of getting your site to
          the top of page one, the downside is that the costs per click can be
          high and difficult to maintain. Companies that use a combination of
          SEO and PPC can be highly successful marketers and gain a lion’s share
          of search traffic for the keywords and key phrases important to the
          company’s success.
